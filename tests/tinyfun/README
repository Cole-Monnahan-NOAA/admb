Example illustrating the use of the TINYFUN macro. 

The defined function has its derivatives calculated 
via forward mode AD and the code for it is generated 
by the macro. 

This is a silly example, but the approach can be used 
for more complicated functions of up to 3 parameters. 

AD up to 3. order is supported, so also models with 
random effects.
